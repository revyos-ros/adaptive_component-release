Description: A composable container for Adaptive ROS 2 Node computations.
 Allows building Nodes that can select between FPGA, CPU or GPU, at run-time. Stateless by default, can be made stateful to meet use-case specific needs. Refer to examples in README. Technically, provides A ROS 2 Node subclass programmed as a &quot;Component&quot; and including its own single threaded executor to build adaptive computations. Adaptive ROS 2 Nodes are able to perform computations in the CPU, the FPGA or the GPU, adaptively. Adaptive behavior is controlled through the &quot;adaptive&quot; ROS 2 parameter.
